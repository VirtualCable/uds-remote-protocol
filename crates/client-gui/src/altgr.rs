//! AltGr (RAlt) pairing for Windows targets (client-side input).
//!
//! On Windows, AltGr is `Ctrl+Alt`: the OS emits a fake LCtrl key-down just
//! before the RAlt key-down and the matching releases afterwards. winit's
//! delivery of those fake events is not reliable (the fake LCtrl key-up can
//! be swallowed), which left Ctrl stuck on the remote until the user tapped
//! Ctrl again. This tracker synthesizes the pairing ourselves:
//!
//! - AltGr down: if no real LCtrl is held, press one synthetically; if an
//!   LCtrl down arrived within [`FAKE_WINDOW`] it is Windows' AltGr fake, so
//!   we take ownership of it (to release it ourselves on AltGr up).
//! - A real LCtrl down while AltGr is held transfers ownership back to the
//!   user (we must not release a key they are physically holding).
//! - AltGr up: release the owned Ctrl.
//!
//! The corner case (user taps the real LCtrl and AltGr within 100 ms) makes
//! us release their Ctrl when AltGr ends — a mild surprise, far better than
//! a silently stuck Ctrl.
